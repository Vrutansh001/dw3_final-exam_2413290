If you **publish your project online**, for example using **AWS EC2**, **Vercel**, or any **public hosting service**,  
you **do NOT need** to:

- Record the video demo  
- Create a GitHub repository  

✅ In this case, you only need to **send me the link** to your live project so I can test it directly.

### 📤 SUBMISSION IS MANDATORY (Omnivox LEA)

Whether you choose to host your project online **or** upload it to **GitHub**,  
you **must submit either**:

- The **link to your GitHub repository**  
**OR**  
- The **link to your live project**

📩 No submission = **No grade**

---

### ⏰ IMPORTANT – Read Carefully

Please read the exam instructions thoroughly. Whether you're submitting a **live project** or using **GitHub**,  
a smart strategy is to **create your GitHub repository or EC2 server right at the beginning of the exam**.

📎 Then, **submit your repository link or the public link to your live project (e.g., from EC2) as soon as possible** to avoid any last-minute issues or missing the deadline.

✅ This way, you can focus on developing your project calmly, without the stress of rushing to submit the link at the end of the exam.

Absolutely! Here's a clear and professional version of the **submission format instructions** in English:

---

### 📩 SUBMISSION FORMAT

Create a **`.txt` file** using Notepad (or any text editor) and name it:

```
final-exam.txt
```

Inside this file, paste **one of the following**:

- The **link to your GitHub repository**  
**OR**  
- The **public link to your live project** (e.g., from EC2)

📝 This `.txt` file is what you will submit on the platform (Omnivox / LEA).
